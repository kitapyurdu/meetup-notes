###### Android Architecture Components

These components are designed to ease your application architecture. You can see them as *design patterns* at an arhitectural view. These are lifecycle-aware components that help you manage your activity and fragment lifecycles. Survive configuration changes, avoid memory leaks and easily load data into your UI.

###### Android Weekly

Also there is a global weekly newsletter, as [android weekly](http://androidweekly.net/). The newsletter comes once a week and covers a broad range of topics like tutorials, screencasts, news... just everything that's awesome in the Android Development world! 

###### Android Support Library

When developing apps that support multiple API versions, you may want a standard way to provide newer features. Without using android support library, your new components won't be supported on a range of APIs or you'll have to cut off support to older API versions. For an industrial perspective this situation is not easy to accept. Your app needs to reach broad range of users with same stability. Easier development and support across more devices!
